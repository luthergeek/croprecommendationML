 This is a machine learning model that I have made using K-nearest neighbours.  In this project I have tried to solve one of the farmers' problems that they havew been facing.  Some famers are chocing crops that are not suitable for planting in their farms. This model advices the farmer on the best  crop to plant on his or her farm.  In this project I have used data from an agricultural database that I found online. The data is in csv format made up of 2200 lines of data. The dataframe contains attributes that are responsible for the recommendation of the best crop to be farmed on a farm. It contains 22 different crops with their respective attributes that were recorded from farms with properties which had the highest harvest.  This project is a crop recommendation system that recommends to the farmes the best crops to be croped in their farm. The program speaks to the user.
